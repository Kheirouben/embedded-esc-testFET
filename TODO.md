embedded-esc-testFET TODO
=========================

* implement an option for alternating between two ADC ports, interleaving the values in `waveform`; this would be important for debugging transient issues
* improve documentation
* make it easier to specify which pins and ports the FET control lines are on
* clean up i2c.py code, putting more methods in classes
